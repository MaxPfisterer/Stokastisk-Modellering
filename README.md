# Stokastisk-Modellering
The two required group projects in TMA4265 - Stochastic Modelling, with calculations in R.

## Project 1
Here we first modelled a measles outbreak with a Markov Chain SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model, investigating the limiting probabilites and modelling the outbreak with both static and dynamic (increasing as a function of the number of infected individuals) probabilities of infection.
In the second part we examine a Poisson process model of a series of insurance claims, finding the probability of the number of claims exceeding some amount in a given time interval, and an estimate for the total amount claimed based of the rate of claims and their expected amount.

## Project 2
In this project we first modelled an urgent care center (UCC) as a (M/M/1) queue, finding the expected time spent in the UCC for patients of high and normal priority, as well as calculating the limiting distribution. We also plotted a few realizations.
The topic of the second part was modelling scientific measurements (albedo of sea ice) as a multivariate Gaussian distribution to estimate the value with the best probability of producing a score below a given threshhold when inserted into a deterministic black-box function. This was done by calculating conditial probabilities of the multivariate distribution for a grid of points, among which were some values that already have been tested. Confidence intervals were plotted together with the expected values.


We also plotted several realizations of the models in both projects, where this made sense.
